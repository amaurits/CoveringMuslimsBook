[_Covering Muslims: American Newspapers in Comparative Perspective_](https://global.oup.com/academic/product/covering-muslims-9780197611722?cc=us&lang=en&), has been available as an electronic book since some time in November 2021.

Paper shortages and supply chain issues aggravated by the COVID-19 pandemic have pushed the print publication dates back a bit. In the United States, the book has been available since December 14, 2021, in both hardcover and paperback.

In most of Europe, it will be available in March 2022. According to [Amazon UK](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Covering-Muslims-Newspapers-Comparative-Perspective/dp/0197611729/ref=sr_1_3), the date is 8 March. However, due to the aforementioned paper shortages, that date is not guaranteed.
