"This book is a must-read for everyone interested in media and minorities. It provides a uniquely comprehensive analysis of media coverage of Muslims unseen in previous contributions on this topic. The empirical contributions presented in this book provide a benchmark for how contemporary scholarship should approach minority coverage in mass media. Conclusions are of great practical relevance for journalism practice"
