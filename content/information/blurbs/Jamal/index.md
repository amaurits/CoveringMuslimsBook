"This is an incredibly powerful book that convincingly illustrates that Muslims are systematically negatively portrayed in Western media. Regardless of subject matter, coverage of Muslims in several OECD countries tends to be more negative than when compared to any other group. The media in the United States, Britain, Canada, and Australia are in fact vehicles that unapologetically continue to promote Islamophobia. In an era where the roots of systemic racism are under scrutiny, it is imperative that the media take a critical inward look as well."
