"Bleich and van der Veen offer an impressively thorough account of negativity in media coverage of Muslims. They find that Muslims receive more negative coverage than a range of other religious and ethnic groups, as farback as 1996, in the United States and across Anglo-American democracies as well. This work raises serious concerns not just for scholars of political communication and ethnic diversity, but for journalists, editors, and news consumers as well."
