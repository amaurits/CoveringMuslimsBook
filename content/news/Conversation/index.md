[The Conversation](https://theconversation.com/global/) is a website featuring news articles about academic research findings.

We worked with the excellent Kalpana Jin (@kalpanajain) as editor to produce a short piece for The Conversation focusing on two important take-away messages from the book: 1) Coverage of Muslims is much more negative than that of other religious groups, and 2) This pattern holds across English-speaking countries in the Global North (i.e. it is not U.S.-specific).
