The [Migration Policy Centre](https://migrationpolicycentre.eu/) at the [European University Institute](https://www.eui.eu/en/home) maintains a valuable [blog](https://blogs.eui.eu/migrationpolicycentre/) featuring articles about issues relevant to migrants. We were invited to contributed a post, which appeared on May 30th. In it, we discuss the overall negativity of the media's coverage of Muslims, and argue for the importance of "tone-checking" such coverage: consciously reflecting on the text of articles in order to develop an awareness of biases and errors.
