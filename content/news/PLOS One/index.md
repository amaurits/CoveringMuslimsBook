A core feature of _Covering Muslims_ is the analysis of how positive/negative newspaper 
coverage of Muslim is. Performing this analysis requires a robust, fine-grained sentiment 
analysis method. Since we were unable to find an existing method that proved acceptable 
for our purposes, we developed our own, [MultiLexScaled](https://github.com/amaurits/MultiLexScaled), which uses multiple sentiment lexica,
calibrated and scaled on a representative corpus of newspaper articles.

The paper introducing the method, long available in preprint form, has now found an official
published home at the general science journal [_PLOS One_](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/). 
Below is one of the figures from the paper, which demonstrates the importance of fine-grained
sentiment analysis, as compared to the binary approach (positive or negative) more common
in machine learning approaches. Click on the figure to go to the article.
