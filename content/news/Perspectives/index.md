[_Perspectives on Politics_](https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/perspectives-on-politics), a journal of the [American Political Science Association](www.apsanet.org), published a back and forth review-and-response _Critical Dialogue_ between us and Elisabeth Ivarsflaten and Paul M. Sniderman, authors of the superb study [_The Struggle for Inclusion: Muslim Minorities and the Democratic Ethos_](https://press.uchicago.edu/ucp/books/book/chicago/S/bo115836307.html) (Chicago, 2022). 

As we wrote in our response to their review, "Juxtaposing the findings of our two books leads to a host of compelling research questions. We look forward to further research that enriches our understanding of the interactions between media coverage and public attitudes toward Muslims and other marginalized groups."
