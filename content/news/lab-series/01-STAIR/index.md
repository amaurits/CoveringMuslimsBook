## STAIR Lab (Systematic Text Analysis for International Relations)

The STAIR Lab is a computational social science lab conducting collaborative research with undergraduate students at William & Mary. We use natural language processing (NLP) tools to study how politicians and the media (both traditional and social media) think and talk about international issues, with a particular focus on international humanitarian questions.
