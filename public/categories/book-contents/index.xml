      <description>The Migration Policy Centre at the European University Institute maintains a valuable blog featuring articles about issues relevant to migrants and migration. We were invited to contributed a post, which appeared on May 30th. In it, we discuss the overall negativity of the media&amp;rsquo;s coverage of Muslims, and argue for the importance of &amp;ldquo;tone-checking&amp;rdquo; such coverage: consciously reflecting on the text of articles in order to develop an awareness of biases and errors.</description>

      <description>The Conversation is a website featuring news articles about academic research findings.
We worked with the excellent Kalpana Jin (@kalpanajain) as editor to produce a short piece for The Conversation focusing on two important take-away messages from the book: 1) Coverage of Muslims is much more negative than that of other religious groups, and 2) This pattern holds across English-speaking countries in the Global North (i.e. it is not U.</description>

We were thrilled to talk about the book with Jobrani and his cohost Tehran for an episode of the podcast &amp;ldquo;Back to School with Maz Jobrani&amp;rdquo;. We discussed key findings in the book, as well as about broader issues related to the book findings, plus whether or not the Netherlands is part of Scandinavia ðŸ˜ƒ.</description>
