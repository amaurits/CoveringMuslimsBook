      <description>Perspectives on Politics, a journal of the American Political Science Association, published a back and forth review-and-response Critical Dialogue between us and Elisabeth Ivarsflaten and Paul M. Sniderman, authors of the superb study The Struggle for Inclusion: Muslim Minorities and the Democratic Ethos (Chicago, 2022).

We look forward to further research that enriches our understanding of the interactions between media coverage and public attitudes toward Muslims and other marginalized groups.</description>
