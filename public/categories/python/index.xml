      <description>Lexicon-based sentiment analysis, using multiple lexica and scaled against representative text corpora.   Sentiment analysis — the study of the positive or negative valence of texts — has wide-ranging applications across the social sciences. Automated approaches make it possible to code near unlimited quantities of texts with full replicability and high accuracy. Compared to machine-learning approaches, lexicon-based methods provide generalizability while sacrificing little in performance and gaining the ability to identify gradations in sentiment as well as cross-domain comparability.</description>
