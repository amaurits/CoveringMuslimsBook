      <description>STAIR Lab (Systematic Text Analysis for International Relations)     STAIR Lab is a computational social science lab conducting collaborative research with undergraduate students at William &amp;amp; Mary. We use natural language processing (NLP) tools to study how politicians and the media (both traditional and social media) think and talk about international issues, with a particular focus on international humanitarian questions.

      <description>MPoMP (Media Portrayal of Minorities Project)     The Media Portrayals of Minorities Project was launched in 2012 at Middlebury College. We use digital sources to better understand depictions of minorities in the media. Our goal is to track and explain how and why media representations of groups shift over time, vary across place, or compare to one another. We use a mix of computer-assisted and human coding techniques that allow us to analyze large quantities of media data.</description>
