      <description>Maurits is Associate Professor of Government at William &amp;amp; Mary in Williamsburg, VA. Prior to coming to William &amp;amp; Mary in 2010, he taught at the University of Georgia and the University of Pennsylvania.
His research investigates the origins and impact of perceptions and beliefs in international relations, with a focus on beliefs about “others”: members of different minorities, (im)migrants, foreigners, etc. As a computational social scientist, he is particularly interested in measuring different aspects of beliefs and attitudes in texts, ranging from legislative debates to newspapers to social media.</description>
