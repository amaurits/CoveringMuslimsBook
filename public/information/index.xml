      <description>Covering Muslims: American Newspapers in Comparative Perspective, has been available as an electronic book since November 2021.
Paper shortages and supply chain issues aggravated by the COVID-19 pandemic pushed the print publication dates back a bit. In the United States, the book has been available since December 14, 2021, in both hardcover and paperback.
In most of Europe, it has been available since 24 March 2022, for instance at Amazon UK.</description>
