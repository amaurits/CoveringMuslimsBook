      <description>A core feature of Covering Muslims is the analysis of how positive/negative newspaper coverage of Muslim is. Performing this analysis requires a robust, fine-grained sentiment analysis method. Since we were unable to find an existing method that proved acceptable for our purposes, we developed our own, MultiLexScaled, which uses multiple sentiment lexica, calibrated and scaled on a representative corpus of newspaper articles.
The paper introducing the method, long available in preprint form, has now found an official published home at the general science journal PLOS One.</description>

      <description>Perspectives on Politics, a journal of the American Political Science Association, published a back and forth review-and-response Critical Dialogue between us and Elisabeth Ivarsflaten and Paul M. Sniderman, authors of the superb study The Struggle for Inclusion: Muslim Minorities and the Democratic Ethos (Chicago, 2022).
As we wrote in our response to their review, &amp;ldquo;Juxtaposing the findings of our two books leads to a host of compelling research questions. We look forward to further research that enriches our understanding of the interactions between media coverage and public attitudes toward Muslims and other marginalized groups.</description>

      <description>The Migration Policy Centre at the European University Institute maintains a valuable blog featuring articles about issues relevant to migrants and migration. We were invited to contributed a post, which appeared on May 30th. In it, we discuss the overall negativity of the media&amp;rsquo;s coverage of Muslims, and argue for the importance of &amp;ldquo;tone-checking&amp;rdquo; such coverage: consciously reflecting on the text of articles in order to develop an awareness of biases and errors.</description>

      <description>The Conversation is a website featuring news articles about academic research findings.
We worked with the excellent Kalpana Jin (@kalpanajain) as editor to produce a short piece for The Conversation focusing on two important take-away messages from the book: 1) Coverage of Muslims is much more negative than that of other religious groups, and 2) This pattern holds across English-speaking countries in the Global North (i.e. it is not U.</description>

      <description>In his Axis of Evil Comedy tour, Maz Jobrani tells a joke that nicely encapsulates a central problem with American media coverage of Muslims. We use it as an epigraph for our first chapter. You can watch it here (it starts around 1:25).
We were thrilled to talk about the book with Jobrani and his cohost Tehran for an episode of the podcast &amp;ldquo;Back to School with Maz Jobrani&amp;rdquo;. We discussed key findings in the book, as well as about broader issues related to the book findings, plus whether or not the Netherlands is part of Scandinavia ðŸ˜ƒ.</description>

Here is page 99 from Covering Muslims:
Surprisingly, it is a page wholely dedicated to a figure displaying trends over time in the number of articles published mentioning Muslims in four different countries. To read our page 99 test story, click on the image below.</description>
